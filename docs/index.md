# SLControl Analysis

The data for our contractile experiments are stored as [SLControl](http://www.slcontrol.org) files. These files are stored as text using a special format and have the extension *.slc.

The SLControl software allows you to open data files and measure features from the records by placing cursors. You can also open SLControl files using code written in MATLAB from the [SLControl utilities repository](http://github.com/Campbell-Muscle-Lab/SLControl_utilities).

A typical research project in the [Campbell Muscle Lab](http://www.campbellmusclelab.org) will produce hundreds of SLControl files. Analyzing these one at a time would be tedious and error-prone.

This site explains how to use software written in MATLAB to analyze certain common types of experiment.
